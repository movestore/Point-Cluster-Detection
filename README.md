# Multiple Animal Cluster Detection

MoveApps

Github repository: *github.com/movestore/Point-Cluster_Detection*

## Description
Detection of point clusters, where possibly more than one animal returns to within a specified time interval. Provides a table of each cluster with the times, duration, number of locations and animals. Clusters close to locations provided in a file 'remove.csv' can be excluded. By setting, only 'new' clusters can be transmitted.

## Documentation
This App uses two types of clustering (buffer overlap or hierarchical clustering) for the detection of point clusters where one or more animals return to repeatedly within a specified time frame. 

For buffer clustering all locations are transformed into a circular spatial polygon of radius `cluster radius`. Then all overlapping polygons (i.e. of which the center locations are less than `2 * cluster radius` apart) are joined into clusters. Only clusters that were used for at least the specified number of hours/days/weeks (dur parameter) are returned. Clusters with time gaps between successive (indiv. independent) locations above the user defined maximum (maxgap parameter) are split. Resulting partial clusters are kept if they fulfill the minimum duration requirement (dur parameter).

For hierarchical clustering the `average` method is used, i.e. the clusters are defined at the minimum average distance between all locations of the clusters. Clusters are selected to have at least a radius of `cluster radius` or be `2 * cluster radius` apart. Only clusters that were used for at least the specified number of hours/days/weeks are returned.

If one has uploaded a comma-separated user file (csv!) of locations (column names must be `longitute` and `latitude`!), this App will automatically exclude those clusters that have centre points less than `rad` metre from the provided locations. That way, fixed stations like nests or other points of attraction can be excluded from the results of this cluster analysis. Note that the previously required name of this file ('remove.csv') is not necessary any more.

According to the maxgap parameter, clusters with usage gaps larger than the defined value are split.

A cluster overview table is returned as a .csv artefact to download. It includes for each cluster the most central location (minimum distance to all other locations), the most used location (if rounded to 4 decimals (+/-11m) which location is most used; note: if there are several candidates, then the one closest to the central location), timestamps of first and last location (UTC and local time), duration, cluster diameter, realised cluster radius (related to most central location), number of locations, cumulative timelag of locations, number of animals, the names of those animals, their tag numbers and their respective duration and number of locations in the cluster. See definition of all parameters in the list(s) below.

The output of the App includes the locations that could be attributed to a cluster (that fulfilled the minimum duration requirement), including the clusterID, number of animals using the cluster, number of locations in and outside the cluster (in the time that the cluster was used and by the individuals that used the clsuter) and number of revisits. This dataset is also returned as a .csv artefact to download, including local timestamps.

If selected, only 'new' clusters can be returned. 'New' means, that those clusters were not found if excluding all locations from the last Y hours (in relation to time or App run). Those clusters from the complete cluster set, which were completely embedded in one cluster of the 'old' data set are not returned. This setting is most useful for regular, scheduled runs of this App and integration into EarthRanger, so as to minimise data traffic.

### Settings 
**Cluster Method (`meth`):** Method to cluster points, either `buff` or `hclust`. See details above in Documentation. Default `buff`.

**Cluster radius (`rad`):** Radius within which locations have to lie to be defined as a cluster. Unit = metre. Default 200 m.

**Minimum duration at a cluster (`dur`):** Duration that a cluster has to be repeatadly visited. Unit below. Default 1.

**Minimum number of locations building a cluster (`minloc`):** Minimum number of locations that a cluster needs to be made up of to be included into the results. Default 1.

**Time duration unit (`dur_unit`):** Duration unit for variable `dur`. Can be `hours`, `days` or `weeks`. Default `days`.

**Maximim gap duration between locations in a cluster (`maxgap`):** Maximum tolerated usage gap duration between successive locations in a cluster. Individuals to who the loations belong are irrelevant. Clusters are split at gaps exceeding this maximum gap duration. Unit below. Default 1.

**Gap duration unit (`gap_unit`):** Duration unit for variable `maxgap`. Can be `hours`, `days` or `weeks`. Default `days`.

**Cluster Transmission Mode (`clu_transm`):** Setting to allow only returning 'new' clusters that were not detected with the data set excluding the previous Y hours. Defaults to returning all clusters.

**Y - number of hours representing 'new' (`new_dur`):** Number of hours that data set shall be compared with to extract only 'new' clusters. Defaults to 24 (h).

**Locations of nests, roost or other sites to remove. (`remo_sites`):** A csv-file with locations, close to which clusters shall be excluded. Defaults to no file.

**Fix rates of the included tracks. (`track_fixrates`):** A csv-file with trackids and fixrates to be added to the output.rds and `Points_With_Clusters.csv` for use in Apps down the line. Mind the spelling of trackids in your data set and also column names 'trackid' and 'fixrate'.

### Most common errors
Please post an issues [here](https://github.com/movestore/Point-Cluster-Detection/issues) if you encounter recurring errors or problems.

### Null or error handling:
**Setting `meth`:** Default `buff` allows no NULL.

**Setting `rad`:** Radius NULL defaults to 200 m. Too small radii might lead to small clusters, please include location inaccuracies here.

**Setting `dur`:** Duration NULL defaults to 1 (day). Too large durations might lead to few clusters.

**Setting `minloc`:** Number NULL defaults to 1. Too large values might lead to few clusters.

**Setting `dur_unit`:** Duration defaults to `days`. Only regular time units can be used (see above).

**Setting `maxgap`:** Duration NULL defaults to 1 (day). Too small maximum gaps might lead to fewer and smaller clusters.

**Setting `gap_unit`:** Duration defaults to `days`. Only regular time units can be used (see above).

**Setting `new_dur`:** If this number is too small, most clusters will be removed.

**Data:** All locations that are in a (any) cluster are returned to the next App. If no clusters are found in your data set NULL is returned, likel with an error.
